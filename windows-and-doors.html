                                                    <p>AN ERA OF SUPERIOR INSULATION IN SLIDING SYSTEMS BEGINS</p>
                                                    <p>Todays, the importance of usage of energy resources and efficient
                                                        usage and saving of energy is increased. 82% of the energy
                                                        utilized by building complexes is used for heating purposes.
                                                        This rate corresponds to approximately 26% of the total energy
                                                        consumed in our country. The heat loss in buildings arises from
                                                        various sources: 40% through exterior walls, 30% through
                                                        windows, 17% through exterior and balcony doors, 7% through
                                                        roofs and 6% through the undersides of flooring. Due to this

                                                        that energy is the most limited and expensive resource gives
